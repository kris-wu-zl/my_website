<p>Although intuitive, one may conduct a statistical analysis on how engine size impact fuel efficiency. In order to do that, we must first call out the packages.</p>
<div id="load-packages" class="section level1">
<h1>Load packages</h1>
<pre class="r"><code># Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(tidyverse)  
library(mosaic)
library(lubridate)
library(fivethirtyeight)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="glimpse-dataframe" class="section level1">
<h1>Glimpse Dataframe</h1>
<p>Next, it is good practice to take a look at the dataframe mpg using a <code>glimpse</code> function</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Have a look at how the dataframe is structured
glimpse(mpg)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Rows: 234

<p>We can observe that the dataframe has 234 rows and 11 columns.
manufacturer specifies the brand.
model specifies the model name under the brand
displ means engine displacement, in litres
year is the year of manufacture of the model
cyl records the number of cylinders of the engine
trans specifies type of transmission
drv means the type of drive train, where f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd
cty records the driving fuel efficiency in cities: city miles per gallon
hwy records the driving fuel efficiency on highways: highway miles per gallon
fl is fuel type
class is “type” of car</p>

<div id="visualize-relationship-between-highway-fuel-efficiency-and-number-of-cylinder" class="section level1">
<h1>Visualize relationship between highway fuel efficiency and number of cylinder</h1>
<p>If you liked the “Need for Speed” feeling of fastness, you probably want more cylinders in the car engine to power a hasty start. What if you are yet environmentally conscious and want a good fuel efficiency as well? Is there a trade-off?</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = hwy))</code></pre>

Clearly, there is a trade-off! It looks like hastier accelerations with more cylinders cost more fuels!</p>
</div>
<div id="visualize-relationship-between-highway-fuel-efficiency-and-displacement" class="section level1">
<h1>Visualize relationship between highway fuel efficiency and displacement</h1>
<p>A better approximation of engine power, rather than cylinder number, is engine displacement, i.e. how much fuel gets absorbed into the engine in one round of piston motion. How may fuel efficiency be correlated with engine displacement? Thus, if we want to check our carbon footprint, do we still want to buy cars with immense fuel displacement? Does the type of car matter in our analysis?</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))</code></pre>

Hooyay! It looks like compact cars have the highest fuel efficiency. No wonder you see them clouding around in Europe! And SUVs are probably the least efficient behemoths. But if you like to conquer hills, muds, and prairies, have them around. 2 seaters are sports cars. Looks like they are the outliers at high range of displacement. But, consider your pocket and road conditions before purchase!</p>
