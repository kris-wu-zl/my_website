<h2>Kris: the Marathoner</h2>
<p>I have spent almost <em>half</em> of my life away from my family. Having studied in China, Singapore, Europe, the US, I do have acquired a <strong>global awareness</strong>.</p>
<p>My proudest achievements are not academics, internships, or photographs taken. It is my <strong>jogging journey</strong>. I did my first ultra-marathon (50km) at age 20. I consider this the best gift bestowed upon self. Over the years, I did travel and ran a lot.</p>
<p>Top locations that I have ran across</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Hong Kong 1300 km</li>
<li>Singapore 600 km</li>
<li>Denmark 240 km</li>
<li>London 113 km</li>
<li>Paris 68 km</li>
</ol>
<p>I have not been updating as much about my running experiences. (because I am not running a lot these days, what a shame!)</p>
