## the Marathoner
I have spent almost *half* of my life away from my family. Having studied in China, Singapore, Europe, the US, I do have acquired a **global awareness**.

My proudest achievements are not academics, internships, or photographs taken. It is my **jogging journey**. I did my first ultra-marathon (50km) at age 20. I consider this the best gift bestowed upon self. Over the years, I did travel and ran a lot.

Top locations that I have ran across

1) Hong Kong 1300 km
2) Singapore 600 km
3) Denmark 240 km
4) London 113 km
5) Paris 68 km

I have not been updating as much about my running experiences. (because I am not running a lot these days, what a shame!)
