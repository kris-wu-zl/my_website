      <description>The UK’s 3rd nation-wide pandemics lockdown is scheduled 14th October. It will be very unfortunate to get infected the virus, especially that a cold winter is approaching. Let’s look at the likelihood of death if you get them. The point is not to scare you, but to warn you to be careful!!!

      <description>Although intuitive, one may conduct a statistical analysis on how engine size impact fuel efficiency. In order to do that, we must first call out the packages.

      <description>the Marathoner I have spent almost half of my life away from my family. Having studied in China, Singapore, Europe, the US, I do have acquired a global awareness.
My proudest achievements are not academics, internships, or photographs taken. It is my jogging journey. I did my first ultra-marathon (50km) at age 20. I consider this the best gift bestowed upon self. Over the years, I did travel and ran a lot.</description>

      <description>I am a fan of movies, not only movies themselves but the numbers of how they have performed, both in ratings and box office. Nonetheless, this is my first ever attempt to look at movie data with R!

      <description>As a finance student, it is interesting to look at time series data and decide which index to invest. We shall see, for this page, how the NYSE-listed stocks performed.

      <title>Which country is the best sales destination for alcohol?</title>

      <description>I was talking to a German friend one day about how good German are at drinking alcohol, he said “the Chinese moutai is nothing”. While taste is kind of personal, I did not feel offended as we were drinking and telling nonsense as well. That was back in Denmark where student orientations typically have challenge activities such as drinking 6 litres of beer. Now, I am intrigued to find out how nationals of different countries love beer, spirits or wine.</description>
