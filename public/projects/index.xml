      <description>the Marathoner I have spent almost half of my life away from my family. Having studied in China, Singapore, Europe, the US, I do have acquired a global awareness.
My proudest achievements are not academics, internships, or photographs taken. It is my jogging journey. I did my first ultra-marathon (50km) at age 20. I consider this the best gift bestowed upon self. Over the years, I did travel and ran a lot.</description>
